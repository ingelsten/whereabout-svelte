<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

The scope of the project is to get a better understanding of the Svelte framework and componests. The projects is best on the idea of a PlaceMark, A point of interest, or POI, is a specific point location that someone may find useful or interesting. In this project, the PlaceMark is a work locations(e.g. Whereabouts) for the utility sector. 

The structure is as follows: A user can greate Wherabouts, the whereabout then contains individual jobs, the job has a value, latitude, longitude, category and assigned employee. The whereabout displayed using a map view supported by the component Leaflet JS and data is displayed in charts using the Frappe component.

***Note this version only allows for manual input of data.***
